<h1 align="center">English with Claudia</h1>

__[Follow this link to the website](https://cla-cif.github.io/english-with-claudia/)__

English with Claudia is the landing pad website for English learners. The website is aimed at learners of all ages and levels who want to improve or maintain their language skills thanks to the tailor-made and flexible teaching method of teacher Claudia. English with Claudia is a clear and easy-to-navigate website: The aim is to arouse curiosity and lead the student effortlessly to the "Contact me" form.

Considering the educational purpose of the website, special attention was paid to accessibility in order to welcome every student. Therefore, high-contrast colours, minimalist animations and light graphics, among others, were preferred.

The text was tested against common [readability indices](https://www.analyzemywriting.com/readability_indices.html#:~:text=A%20readability%20index%20is%20an,the%20complexity%20of%20a%20text.) and refined to be easily understood by most users. The text presenting the English lessons should not be difficult to read, as the intended users are indeed learners.

White was chosen for an optimal contrast ratio between background and text. 
    - __Typography__
        -   'Oswald' for headings and 'Nunito' for paragraphs and other elements, paired as suggested by Google Fonts. 
    - __Images__

![Hero](https://github.com/cla-cif/english-with-claudia/blob/main/screenshot/hero.jpeg)

- __'About me' section__

  - The 'About me' section includes a picture of the teacher, a welcome message and a brief description of the teacher's professional experience and goals. The picture was chosen to inspire confidence and the welcome message is intended to reassure the user and encourage them to read on. The biography has been deliberately kept short so that it does not become boring. At the end of the bio, there is a prompt to learn more and a link to the social media buttons in the footer.

![About me](https://github.com/cla-cif/english-with-claudia/blob/main/screenshot/aboutme.jpeg)

- __'Services' section__

  - This section answers the question that most users/students will ask at some point: "are these lessons right for me?". The section introduces in a few concise sentences the three main features of the teaching service: "tailored", "strategic" and "flexible".
  - Each feature is accompanied by an image that matches the page message and website colours. The images are simple, easy to understand and convey a message that is aligned with the website's objectives.
  - The times, hours and conditions will be updated whenever necessary.

## Testing 

### General Testing 

The website's features were thoroughly tested using some well-known free web testers. Particular attention was paid to SEO and accessibility as the website offers educational resources.

- __Web Responsive__
The responsive feature has been tested using Chrome DevTools and an online Web [Design checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/checker.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcla-cif.github.io%2Fenglish-with-claudia%2F&width=1400&height=700). 
The website's layout has been tested on a range of different screen sizes, from small 320x480 screens (e.g. Apple iPhone 3) to widescreen 24" and their landscape view providing a good user experience. 
The website has passed the [Google mobile-friendly test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly/result?id=a6mUE2LpdV19X1xP-L4ljA). 
Note: Images and the submit form have been removed from the small screen layout for better readability and a warning message is displayed instead.

- __Accessibility__

  - __Colours:__ All colours checked with [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) have an optimal contrast ratio. 
  - __Colour blindness:__ Colour-blind webpage filters have been taken into account with [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/).
  - __Screen Reader:__ Texts, links and images' 'alt text' were read with the Google Chrome extension Screen Reader (version 53.0.2784.13). 
  - __Presbiopia:__ All fonts are 'sans serif' and have a sufficient size so that the text can be easily read without glasses.
  - __Readability:__ As the main target audience is English language learners, the text was rated 'easy to understand', as tested with [WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/check.php?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcla-cif.github.io%2Fenglish-with-claudia%2F&tab=Test+By+Url&imahuman=16749697)

  - The general performance was evaluated by [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/cla-cif.github.io/9nvWRL91/).

- __Bugs and problems__
  - Images present the best compromise between quality and size. [JPEGMiniPRo](https://www.jpegmini.com/creators) was used to reduce the image size while ensuring minimal quality loss. However, low scores on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) side were achieved.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

 1. As a First-time visitor, I want to understand if the services are suitable for me. 
    -   The three courses offered are immediately visible in the welcome image with a high-contrast text overlay. 
    - The user has two options: Click on the "About Me" link in the navigation bar or scroll to learn more in the "About Me" section immediately following.
          
 2. As a First-time visitor and a learner, I want the text to be easy to decipher, short and written in a rather casual language. 
    - The texts were carefully edited using text analysis tools and text editors to make them as easy to read as possible. Inexperienced language users may find long sentences and academic vocabulary challenging to understand and frustrating. 
    - Texts have been intentionally kept short to avoid information overload. More information can be obtained via social media and by contacting the teacher.

 3. As a First-time first-time visitor with an impairment, I want to be able to navigate the website easily to find information, read all the text by myself or with a screen reader, find colours that are not misleading, and find animations disabled if so set.
     - Colours contrast with the background and are colour blindness friendly as information is still clear regardless of visual impairment.
     - Font sizes are sufficiently large by default and therefore easy to read.
     - All text, labels and images are readable with the Chrome Screen Reader extension.
     - Animations are disabled when the user sets the "prefer reduced motion" option.
        
 4. As a First-time visitor, I may want to learn more about the service on social media.
     - Right after a short bio in the "About me" section, a "find out more" link lands the user to the footer section where a LinkedIn, Facebook and TikTok icons are displayed and open on a new tab. 
     - The user can also scroll to the bottom of the page till the footer.
        
 5. As a First-time visitor, I want to engage with the organisation easily, quickly and effectively.
     - There is a direct link in the navigation bar to the "Contact me" section and the relevant form.
     - Right after the teacher's short bio, the user can follow the "find out more" link which lands to the footer. The "Contact me" section will be within the same viewport height.
     - The contact me form is logically placed after all the important information has been provided. It is simple, easy to find and fill out. The size is more than sufficient to allow easy completion.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

 1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information, prices, conditions and timetables always up to date. 
     - The information in the third text area from the top in the "Services" section is constantly updated, as is the "About Me" section and anything else that might change.
    
 2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
     - The "Contact me" link is available in the navigation bar and takes the user to the forms section in the "Contact me" section.
          
 3. As a Returning impaired visitor, I want to find the same as before or even or better accessibility. 
     - Accessibility remains a top priority for developers.
