# English With Claudia

English with Claudia is the landing pad website for English students. The site is targeted toward learners of all ages and levels who aim to stay fluent or improve their language skills thanks to a tailored and flexible teaching method provided by the teacher Claudia. English with Claudia is straighforward and easy to browse: the aim is to stimulate curiosity and get the student to the "Contact me" form in less than three clicks. 

Given the educational purpose of the website, a special accent was put on accessibility to welcome any student, therefore high-contrast colors and a light graphic where priviliged among other choices.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The full responsive navigation bar is made for easy navigation across all devices. It includes links to the "About Me" section and "Contact Me" form which is the     website's core. The navigation bar is intentionally fixed to the top to avoid distraction and convey each section message in the most clear and direct way.

- __About me Section__

  - The About me section includes a picture of the teacher, a greeting message and a brief description of the teacher's professional experience and goal. The picture's aim is  to inspire confidence and the welcome message's aim is to put the user at ease and encourage further reading. The bio was intentionally kept short as not to result boring. At the end of the bio there's and invitation to find out more that links to the social media buttons of the footer.

- __Services section__

  - This section replies to the question most users/students will ask themselves at some point, "are these lessons right for me?". The section presents in a few effective sentences the three main features of the teaching service: "tailored", "strategical" and "flexible". 
  - Each feature is accompanied by an image in line with the side message and the webisite colours. Images are simple, easy to understand and convey a message inspired to the website goals.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
