__[Follow this link to the website](https://cla-cif.github.io/english-with-claudia/)__

English with Claudia is the landing pad website for English students. The site is targeted toward learners of all ages and levels who aim to stay fluent or improve their language skills thanks to a tailored and flexible teaching method provided by the teacher Claudia. English with Claudia is straighforward and easy to browse: the aim is to stimulate curiosity and get the student to the "Contact me" form in less than three clicks. 

Given the educational purpose of the website, a special accent was put on accessibility to welcome any student, therefore high-contrast colors and a light graphic where priviliged among other choices.

-  ### Design

    - __Colours__
        -   The two main colours used are orange and white. Orange was chosen because it's an energetic and attention-grabbing colour as psychologists suggest [here](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-color-psychology-of-orange-2795818). White was chosen for an optimal contrast ratio between background and text. 
    - __Typography__
        -   'Oswald' for headings and 'Nunito' for paragraphs and other elements, paired as suggested by Google Fonts. 
    - __Images__
        -   The images are simple and inviting. All of them have an alt text to maximise accessibility. 

## Features 

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Accessible for hearing and visual impairments
-   Interactive elements

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The full responsive navigation bar is made for easy navigation across all devices. It includes links to the "About Me" section and "Contact Me" form which is the     website's core. The navigation bar is intentionally fixed to the top to avoid distraction and convey each section message in the most clear and direct way. 
 
![Nav Bar](https://github.com/cla-cif/english-with-claudia/blob/main/screenshot/nav.jpeg)

- __The landing page image__

  - The landing includes a photograph with contrast text overlay which allows the user to instantly catch the three main services offered by the teacher. 

![Hero](https://github.com/cla-cif/english-with-claudia/blob/main/screenshot/hero.jpeg)

- __About me Section__

  - The About me section includes a picture of the teacher, a greeting message and a brief description of the teacher's professional experience and goal. The picture's aim is  to inspire confidence and the welcome message's purpose is to put the user at ease and encourage further reading. The bio was intentionally kept short as not to result boring. At the end of the bio there's and invitation to find out more that links to the social media buttons in the footer section. 

![About me](https://github.com/cla-cif/english-with-claudia/blob/main/screenshot/aboutme.jpeg)

- __Services section__

  - This section replies to the question most users/students will ask themselves at some point, "are these lessons right for me?". The section presents in a few effective sentences the three main features of the teaching service: "tailored", "strategical" and "flexible". 
  - Each feature is accompanied by an image in line with the side message and the webisite colours. Images are simple, easy to understand and convey a message inspired to the website goals. 
  - Times, hours and conditions will be updated whenever necessary.

  - The contact me section is intuitive and presented with the promise of getting a reply within 24 hours. The form is placed on the right to ease the natural eye movement from left to right of Western readers.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer's right section includes links to the relevant social media sites of English with Claudia and the teacher. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the users. 
  - The footer's left section includes links to the "About" and "Top" of the page, anchored to the header. This section is intentionally placed right under the submit button in case the user wants to go back to some relevant information before submitting the form. 
  - The footer purpose is to invite the user to find out more about the teaching method and the teacher's bio.
