<h1 align="center">English with Claudia</h1>

__[Follow this link to the website](https://cla-cif.github.io/english-with-claudia/)__

English with Claudia is the landing pad website for English learners. The website is aimed at learners of all ages and levels who want to improve or maintain their language skills thanks to the tailor-made and flexible teaching method of teacher Claudia. English with Claudia is a clear and easy-to-navigate website: The aim is to arouse curiosity and lead the student effortlessly to the "Contact me" form.

Considering the educational purpose of the website, special attention was paid to accessibility in order to welcome every student. Therefore, high-contrast colours, minimalist animations and light graphics, among others, were preferred.

The text was tested against common [readability indices](https://www.analyzemywriting.com/readability_indices.html#:~:text=A%20readability%20index%20is%20an,the%20complexity%20of%20a%20text.) and refined to be easily understood by most users. The text presenting the English lessons should not be difficult to read, as the intended users are indeed learners.

- __About me section__

  - The 'About Me' section includes a picture of the teacher, a welcome message and a brief description of the teacher's professional experience and goals.

  - Each feature is accompanied by an image that matches the page message and website colours. The images are simple, easy to understand and convey a message that is aligned with the website's objectives.
  - The times, hours and conditions will be updated whenever necessary.
