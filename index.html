      <p>
        I am a full-time English teacher based in Italy. I am a CELTA certified
        teacher with a BA in Literature and Journalism and Mass Communication
        and have over 8 years of teaching experience. I speak with a distinct
        southern British accent and I am fluent in Italian, French and
        Hebrew.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the opportunity to work with business students,
        army personnel, private tutors and academics. I can proudly say that l
        have developed a teaching method that is very adaptable to the needs of each student.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in the corporate world has proved particularly useful when teaching
        business English to adults. I am very happy to be able to share my
        knowledge with my students, so that they can not only learn English but
        also understand the basic principles of business culture in English-speaking countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have learned that each of us has a different learning pace and
        approach. As your teacher, I will guide you through this process and
        explain each step carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will encourage you to ask me questions and be curious about why we are reading
        texts, doing grammar exercises or practising pronunciation.
