      <p>
        I am a full-time English Teacher based in Italy. I am CELTA certified
        teacher with a BA in Literature and Journalism and Mass Communication
        and have over 8 years of teaching experience. I speak in a clear
        Southern British English accent, I am fluent in Italian, French and
        Hebrew.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the opportunity to work with students from Corporate world,
        army staff, private tutoring and academics. I am proud to say that l
        have developed a teaching method that is very adaptable to every
        student's need.
      </p>
      <p>
        My corporate experience has proved particularly handy in teaching
        Business English to adults, and I am really happy I can share my
        knowledge with my students, so they can not only learn English but
        also grasp fundamental principles of business culture in English
        speaking countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have learned that each of us have a different learning pace and
        different approaches. As your teacher I will guide you through and
        explain carefully each and every step of that process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will push you to ask me questions and be curious why we are reading
        texts, doing grammar exercises or practising pronunciation.
